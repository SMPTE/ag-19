    <p>General rules for Projects:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>For every SMPTE document being worked on, there should be a SMPTE Project associated with that document</li>
      <li>Work that requires multiple documents should have a parent project that references all child projects for the documents being worked on. TC Chairs may rule that a parent project is not needed.</li>
      <li>At the discretion of the Technology Committee, a Sub Group may be allocated one or more projects (see <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operation-manual"></a>).</li>

    <h2> Project Completion States</h2>
    <p>The states given below relate to the definition of the document states for different document types in the <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operation-manual"></a> or in <a href="#bib-smpte-ag-22"></a>. The trigger(s) for transition to another state are given in italics in parenthesis.</p>
    <p class="note">In all cases, the project chair is responsible for updating the project completion state where the state less than or equal to 90%. HQ updates the state above 90%.</p>
    <p class="note">DP vote comments and ST Audit comments are actually late comments on an FCD ballot and the Project Chair should determine the status according to whether such comments are to be addressed or deferred according to the <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operation-manual"></a>.</p>
